# wildlife-Detection
*Tensorflow - MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture (53 layers deep) that is very effective for object detection and segmentation.
This  R-CNN can classify images upto 1000 object categories including a wide variety of animals covering almost entire wild animals threatening to humans. Once the animal is identified, appropriate alert messages are sent to the forest official.

*PointRend (Point-based Rendering) neural network module: a module that performs point-based segmentation predictions at adaptively selected locations based on an iterative subdivision algorithm. It is used to segment multiple objects from a frame.

*SMTP algorithm is used to send alert mail to the forest official in our case.
